## Manually Annotated Sentiment Lexicon

To create the sentiment lexicon, we selected tweets that we first manually classified as [negative and positive](https://github.com/hausanlp/NaijaSenti/blob/main/sections/annotated_twitter_corpus.md) and tag words that are positive or negative. 

We mclassified as positive and negative above and manually tagged positive, negative and hate words in the tweets.
